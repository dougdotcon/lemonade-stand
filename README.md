## 1. Donation Button

The simplest form of funding involves placing a donation button on your website or repository. Services like **Stripe** and **PayPal** facilitate these transactions.

*   **Pros:**
    *   Low barrier to entry; minimal administrative overhead.
    *   "Set it and forget it" approach.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Generally yields low revenue unless actively managed.
    *   Processing fees apply.
    *   Tax deductibility for donors usually requires a 501(c)(3) nonprofit status (US) or equivalent, which is difficult for individuals to obtain. Fiscal hosts like [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) or [NumFOCUS](https://www.numfocus.org) can bridge this gap.

## 2. Bounties

Contributors solve specific issues for a monetary reward.

*   **Examples:** [IssueHunt](https://issuehunt.io), [BountySource](https://bountysource.com)

## 3. Sponsorware

Release features exclusively to financial supporters (backers/sponsors) for a set period before making them public.

*   **Pros:** High incentive for sponsorship.
*   **Cons:** Can alienate the wider community if not handled transparently.

## 4. Crowdfunding (One-Time)

Campaigns to fund a specific feature, release, or milestone.

*   **Examples:** [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com), [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com)

## 5. Crowdfunding (Recurring)

Ongoing support from the community via platforms that handle monthly contributions.

*   **Examples:** [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com), [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com), [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com)

## 6. Books and Merchandise

Sell physical goods (t-shirts, stickers) or digital products (books, courses) related to the project.

## 7. Advertising & Sponsorships

Display third-party ads or feature sponsored content within documentation, newsletters, or the application itself.

## 8. Get Hired to Work on Project

Large companies hire open source maintainers to ensure the health of critical infrastructure they rely on.

## 9. Start a Project While Employed

Develop a project within the scope of your current employment, usually under an open source policy.

## 10. Grants

Apply for funding from non-profit foundations or government bodies aimed at supporting open source development.

*   **Examples:** [Mozilla Open Source Support](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/moss/), [NLNet Foundation](https://nlnet.nl/)

## 11. Consulting

Offer specialized expertise and development services related to the project.

## 12. Paid Support

Provide guaranteed SLAs, installation help, or training for the software.

## 13. SaaS (Software as a Service)

Host a managed version of the software, charging users for convenience and reliability.

*   **Example:** [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)

## 14. Copyleft + Paid License

Dual license the software: use it for free under Copyleft (GPL), or buy a proprietary license for closed-source integration.

## 15. Open Core

The core functionality is open source, but advanced features, integrations, or enterprise capabilities are proprietary.

*   **Example:** [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com)

## 16. Foundations & Consortia

Establish a non-profit entity to manage donations and grants, ensuring long-term sustainability and neutrality.

## 17. Venture Capital

Seek investment to build a commercial company around the open source project, aiming for high growth and market capture.

## 18. Restricted License

Use licenses (e.g., BSL) that restrict usage for certain entities (usually large corporations) or for a limited time period.
